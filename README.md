# Mathematics-for-Intelligent-Systems

Course Objectives
- The course will lay down the basic concepts and techniques of linear algebra, calculus and basic 
probability theory needed for subsequent study 
- It will explore the concepts initially through computational experiments and then try to understand the 
concepts/theory behind it.
- At the same time, it will provide an appreciation of the wide application of these disciplines within the 
scientific field
- Another goal of the course is to provide connection between the concepts of linear algebra, differential 
equation and probability theory.
