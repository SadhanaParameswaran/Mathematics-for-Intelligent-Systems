We tried processing a method to predict breast cancer on the basis of ten individual attributes, including radius, texture,  perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry and fractal dimension. The mean, standard error, and worst of these features are computed for each image which results in 30 features.
Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify valuable parts of the data and further reduce the dimensions of the data and identify these features that causes breast cancer using a dataset and we use Logistic regression to create a model and predict the output.
