Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that is related to the study of lines and planes, vector spaces and mappings that are required for linear transformation. Since it is the mathematics of data, the tools of linear algebra are used in many domains such as machine learning, robotics , biology and so on. Linear algebra also plays a major role in genetics. Genetics is a branch of biology concerned with the study of genes, genetic variation, and heredity in organisms. With the help of linear algebra, the genotype of the existing individual can be found out. 
Since the distribution varies over generations, matrices may be used to calculate the probability of each trait in each generation. To evaluate these characteristics, we can use matrix transformations, which is a part of linear algebra. Each row of the matrix represents the potential offspring genotypes, while each column of the matrix represents a mixture of parents' genotypes. This method makes it simple to decide the genotype of the nth generation. Since manual calculation is extremely difficult and time consuming, the diagonalization approach has been used to determine the genotype.
